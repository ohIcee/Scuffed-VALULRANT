Multiplayer FPS Game I created using the [Mirror Networking](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror/) Library for Unity.

It was supposed to be an attempt at re-creating Valorant but I ran out of time so here's a CSGO copy with only the deathmatch gamemode and bugs.

Working features:
- Usernames
- Lobby
- Shooting (damage, hitmarkers, damage indicator, sounds)
- FFA gamemode (BOMB does not work)
- Buying kevlar

What doesn't work:
- You tell me ;)

(if you want to play with friends you have to forward the 7777 port).
